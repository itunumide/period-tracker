## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itunumide/period-tracker.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd period-tracker
```

### 3. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 4. Activate the virtual environment

#### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS/Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and visit:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## How It Works

The user provides information such as:

* Period start date
* Period length
* Average cycle length

The application uses this information to calculate estimates such as:

```text
Period start date
       |
       v
Current cycle day
       |
       v
Estimated next period
       |
       v
Estimated ovulation
       |
       v
Estimated fertile window
```

These calculations are intended for personal tracking and are not medical predictions.

## Database

The application uses SQLite to store user and cycle information.

### Users

```text
id
name
email
password
created_at
```

### Periods

```text
id
user_id
start_date
end_date
cycle_length
period_length
created_at
```

### Symptoms

```text
id
user_id
period_id
symptom
severity
date
```

## Privacy and Security

Period and symptom information can be sensitive personal data.

The application should:

* Hash passwords instead of storing them as plain text
* Ensure users can only access their own records
* Validate submitted data
* Protect authenticated routes
* Use secure sessions
* Use HTTPS when deployed
* Avoid collecting unnecessary personal information

This project is currently under development.
